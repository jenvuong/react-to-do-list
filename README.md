# Simple To Do List using React + Vite

This is my first React project! Featuring a simple to do list rendered with a minimalistic user interface.

## Features

This build allows users to create, store and update their own to-do list!  
Users can keep track of completed tasks with the updated styling that is applied as tasks are marked 'done'.  
Users are able to see their progress as they complete tasks and feel motivated to check off the next task!

Click the Deployments menu to the right to see the code in action!
